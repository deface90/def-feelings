# def-feelings

**def-feelings** is a simple application to save and store you current feelings
to make you begin analyze your current physical and emotional conditions.

---

Actually it's just an attempt to create some base backend and frontend
templates for future pet projects :) You can you use it as you wish.

## Deployment

Use `docker-compose.yaml` to deploy application on the most of the platforms.
See `.env-example` for config variables.
Probable, you would need to use `nginx` or another reverse proxy to correct 
routing to backend and frontend.

## Demo
You can see demo at `feelings.deface.dev`
